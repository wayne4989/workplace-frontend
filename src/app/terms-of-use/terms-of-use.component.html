		<p>When you share information, others can see, copy and use that information.</p>

Information and content that you share or post may be seen by other Members or, if public, by Visitors. Where we have made settings available, we will honour the choices you make about who can see content or information (e.g., sharing to a group instead of your profile page, changing the default setting for content from public to a more restricted view, limiting your profile visibility, or not letting people know when you change your profile, make recommendations or follow companies). Note that other activities, such as applying for a job, are by default private, only visible to the addressee(s).</p>
		<p>We are not obligated to publish any information or content on our Service and can remove it in our sole discretion, with or without notice.</p>

		<h4 class="heading">3. Rights and Limits</h4>

		<p>While we may edit and make formatting changes to your content (such as translating it, modifying the size, layout or file type or removing metadata), we will not modify the meaning of your expression.</p>

To the extent allowed by law, the English version of this Agreement is binding and other translations are for convenience only. This Agreement (including additional terms that may be provided by us when you engage with a feature of the Services) is the only agreement between us regarding the Services and supersedes all prior agreements for the Services.</p>
